## About Me

My name is Aidan T. Manning.
I graduated from UT Austin in May 2020 with a bachelor's degree
in computational chemistry and a certificate in computer science.
My primary interests are in low-level and systems programming, 
server programming, and software to aid scientific research and 
education. I'm currently seeking full-time employment in a software
engineering or software design role.

I started college as a pure chemistry major, and had been doing 
research with professors since high school. In the summer before 
my sophomore year, a friend convinced me to try programming, telling
me I'd like it because of my proclivity for math and language. I
started by learning Python and JavaScript and immediately took a 
liking to it. So I pivoted more toward computational chemistry, which
is all about simulating chemical phenomena and working with large 
data sets. I love my science background but currently I'm also interested
in software engineering. 

All of my software projects (that are worth showing off) 
are available on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/periodicaidan).

## About This Website

The purpose of this website is to be a platform for me to show off
and explain what I'm working on, what kinds of things I've been
learning, and just to post my unsolicited opinions on things that
interest and affect me. As for my [github.io website](https://periodicaidan.github.io),
I will probably use it for hosting software demos and so forth.

I have a lot of plans to add features to this website, for example,
creating my own git project explorer and creating an easy way for people
to contact me about freelance work.

Feel free to explore this website to your heart's content. If you find
a bug please inform me via [email](mailto:periodicaidan@gmail.com).
